## Setup (Customization) </div>

Even tho editing the code is very simple, here's a quick guide that might help you!

<details closed="">
    <summary><b>Welcome Message</b></summary>

To customize, most of the things are in `script.js`, including the welcome message.

First, head over to line 83.

There, you'll find the message in pure text. Just edit it to your liking, as simple as that.

<details closed="">
    <summary><b>Commands</b></summary>

For this one, we're still in `script.js`.

You'll find the commands at the top.

The 1st line of the bit of code should be the command name, while the rest is the output.

Here's an example of how a command should look like:

```
repo: `
Repository link: https://github.com/c1bles/T3RM1N4L/
```
> Don't forget to add your newly made command to the `help` one, _unless you want to make it a secretttt..._

</details>

<details closed="">
    <summary><b>Themes</b></summary>

For the themes, we need to go venture out into the `styles.css` file.

This one is really straightforward, as you just need to change the hex values.
